Royal-Selfbot is an experimental Node.js library for interacting with the Discord API using a user account (self-bot). It aims to provide a familiar structure similar to libraries like discord.js, but adapted for user tokens. Includes support for `@discordjs/voice`.

---

## üöÄ Setup

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Obtain Your User Token

This is the riskiest step. You typically need to extract it from the Discord web client's developer tools (Network or Application > Local Storage tab).  
**NEVER SHARE YOUR TOKEN.** It grants full access to your account.

### 1. Create a `.env` file

In your project's root directory, add your token:

```env
# .env
DISCORD_USER_TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_USER_TOKEN_HERE
```

> **Use code with caution.**

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
npm install royal-selfbot @discordjs/voice ws axios dotenv libsodium-wrappers
# or
yarn add royal-selfbot @discordjs/voice ws axios dotenv libsodium-wrappers
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Basic Usage Example

```js
// example.js
require('dotenv').config();
const { Client } = require('royal-self'); // Use the actual package name if installed

const client = new Client();

client.on('ready', (readyClient) => {
    console.log(`Logged in as ${readyClient.user.tag}!`);
    console.log(`Watching ${readyClient.guilds.cache.size} guilds.`);
});

client.on('messageCreate', async (message) => {
    // Ignore messages from self
    if (message.author?.id === client.user?.id) return;

    console.log(`[${message.guild?.name || 'DM'}] #${message.channel?.name || 'DM'}: ${message.author?.tag}: ${message.content}`);

    // Simple ping command
    if (message.content.toLowerCase() === '!selfping') {
        try {
            const replyMsg = await message.reply('Pong!');
            console.log(`Sent reply: "${replyMsg.content}"`);
        } catch (err) {
            console.error("Failed to send reply:", err);
        }
    }

    // Example: Get user info
    if (message.content.toLowerCase() === '!myinfo') {
         try {
             await message.channel.send(`Your Tag: ${message.author.tag}\nYour ID: ${message.author.id}`);
         } catch (err) {
             console.error("Failed to send user info:", err);
         }
    }
});

client.on('error', (error) => {
    console.error('[Client Error]', error);
});

console.log("Logging in...");
client.login(process.env.DISCORD_USER_TOKEN)
    .then(() => {
        console.log("Login successful, client is ready.");
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error("Login failed:", error);
        process.exit(1);
    });
```

## üîä Voice Usage (Limited for User Tokens)

Programmatically joining voice channels using `joinVoiceChannel` is **blocked by Discord for user tokens** and will likely fail or cause errors if enabled in `VoiceManager`.

The library includes the necessary `voiceAdapterCreator` for `@discordjs/voice` integration if you were using a bot token or if you find alternative (likely unsupported/risky) methods to establish the voice connection.

**Conceptual Example (will likely fail with user tokens):**

```js
// --- THIS WILL LIKELY FAIL WITH USER TOKENS DUE TO DISCORD RESTRICTIONS ---
// const { joinVoiceChannel, createAudioPlayer, createAudioResource, AudioPlayerStatus } = require('@discordjs/voice');
// const TARGET_GUILD_ID = 'YOUR_GUILD_ID';
// const TARGET_VOICE_CHANNEL_ID = 'YOUR_VC_ID';

// client.on('ready', async (readyClient) => {
//   console.log(`Logged in as ${readyClient.user.tag}!`);
//   const guild = readyClient.guilds.cache.get(TARGET_GUILD_ID);
//   const channel = guild?.channels.cache.get(TARGET_VOICE_CHANNEL_ID);

//   if (guild && channel && channel.isVoice()) { // Assuming isVoice() method exists
//     try {
//       console.log(`Attempting to join voice channel ${channel.name}...`);
//       const connection = joinVoiceChannel({
//         channelId: channel.id,
//         guildId: guild.id,
//         adapterCreator: guild.voiceAdapterCreator, // Uses the library's adapter
//       });

//       connection.on(VoiceConnectionStatus.Ready, () => {
//         console.log(`Voice connection Ready in ${channel.name}!`);
//         // Example: Play silence or audio
//         // const player = createAudioPlayer();
//         // connection.subscribe(player);
//         // const resource = createAudioResource(/* ... */);
//         // player.play(resource);
//       });

//       connection.on('error', console.error);
//       // Add other state handlers (Connecting, Disconnected, Destroyed)

//     } catch (error) {
//       console.error(`Failed to join voice channel:`, error);
//     }
//   } else {
//     console.error('Target guild or voice channel not found or invalid.');
//   }
// });
// --- END OF CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE ---

## üí° Features (Conceptual)

- Event handling for common Discord gateway events (Ready, Message Create, etc.)
- Sending and managing messages
- Basic REST API interaction (fetching users, guilds, channels)
- Integration with `@discordjs/voice` for joining voice channels and potentially playing audio
- Basic caching for guilds, channels, users
